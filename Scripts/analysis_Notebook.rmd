## Goal

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This document provides a walk through of analysing Fetch's data and the steps taken for statistical modelling.

### Loading data

Let's load all the required for this project:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#This code appears
```
Below is an overview of the data:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
fetch_daily_receipt_count_df <- read.csv('Data/data_daily.csv')
head(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
