# Goal

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This document provides a walk through of analysing Fetch's data and the steps taken for statistical modelling.

## Loading data

Let's load all the required for this project:

Below is an overview of the data:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
fetch_daily_receipt_count_df <- read.csv('Data/data_daily.csv')
head(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
Let's do some data pre-processing and data cleaning:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#Formatting column names to lowercase.
names(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df) <- tolower(names(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df))

# Rename the "# date" column to "date_receipt_count"
names(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)[1] <- "date_of_receipt_count"

head(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
Let's check the data types of the columns:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
str(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
For further analysis, we need to convert the 'date_of_receipt_count' column to Date data type.
```{r}
fetch_daily_receipt_count_df$date_of_receipt_count <- as.Date(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df$date_of_receipt_count)
str(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
Let's check for any missing values:
```{r}
#Checking for missing values
sum(is.na(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df))
```
Our dataset now looks clean and ready for analysis.
```{r}
head(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
summary(fetch_daily_receipt_count_df)
```
# Exploratory Data Analysis
Let's first plot our time series dataset and get an overview of the situation. 
```{r}
#Plotting
library(ggplot2)
graph_plot <- ggplot(data = fetch_daily_receipt_count_df, aes(x = date_of_receipt_count,
                                                              y = receipt_count))
graph_plot <- graph_plot + geom_line(color = 'blue') + labs(x = 'Date',
                                                            y = 'Number of receipts Fetch received')
graph_plot
```

## Understanding Time Series Regression Analysis

Understanding the relationship between variables and how they evolve over time is crucial when constructing an accurate prediction model.

A time series relationship can be decomposed as follows:

$$series = trend + seasonality + cycles + error$$

### *Trend* 

Variables may oscillate around a ***stable*** *<u>average value</u>*, or they may have an *<u>overall tendency</u>* to either go ***downwards*** or ***upwards***.

This overall direction in which variables move is called ***trend***.
